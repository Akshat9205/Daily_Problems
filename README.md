🚀 Daily DSA Practice in Java

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Practice Repository**!  
Here, I consistently upload my **daily Java solutions** for classic and modern **Data Structures & Algorithms problems**.

🧭 About This Repository

This repo reflects my journey of improving **problem-solving skills** through consistent daily coding.  
Each solution is written in **Java**, focusing on:
- ✅ Clean and readable code  
- ⚙️ Optimized approaches (after brute-force)  
- 🧩 Proper problem naming and folder structure

📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized in a simple and consistent way —  
each Java file corresponds to a single **DSA problem**.  

Every file name clearly represents the problem it solves (e.g., `Peak_element.java`, `Two_sum_II.java`),  
making it easier to revisit, debug, and track progress over time.

Each solution folder may include:
- **Brute-force approach** for clarity and understanding of logic.  
- **Optimized approach** for better time and space complexity.  
- **Comments and explanation** for future reference.  
- **Problem name or reference** (LeetCode / Codeforces / GFG).  

I keep the structure lightweight and readable — no unnecessary subfolders —  
just direct, well-labeled `.java` files to focus purely on **logic and problem-solving flow**.

> 💡 This layout is designed for fast access and easy scalability —  
> as the number of problems grows, I can directly jump to any file and continue improving.
